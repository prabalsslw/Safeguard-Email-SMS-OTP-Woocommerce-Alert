Stop Brute force hacking attempts, and keep your data safe!

    * Easy to install!
    * Easy to replace the Email system with an SMS Gateway
    * WordPress 4.0 Ready!

== Installation ==

Copy the "secure-login" folder to your WordPress Plugins directory via FTP. The WordPress Plugins directory is situated in "/wp-content/plugins/"

Once the "secure-login" folder has been copied to the WordPress Plugins directory, log in to your WordPress admin area (http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin).

Click on the "Plugins" menu item. You will be redirected to the Plugins page. Locate the "Safegaurd" plugin, and click activate.

**Note:** In order to use this plugin, you will need a valid WordPress install. This plugin will not work on a wordpress.com hosted site, and has not been tested on a Multi Site install.

In order for this plugin to function correctly, you will need to use a permalink structure that uses rewrite rules. The "Post name" structure is recommended.

For accurate login time tracking, make sure your correct Timezone is selected under "Settings" > "General".
